# Invitify - a Node.js demo app using express and ejs

This demo app is taken directly from Steve Sanderson's brilliant set of tutorials for working with [node.js in WebMatrix 2](http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/07/09/node-js-development-with-webmatrix-2-and-express/) 

Because of the rapid development of node, these tutorials are already out-of-date (express 3.0 breaks layouts in ejs).

It is my aim to update this tutorial and attempt to keep it updated with the various updates of dependent packages.

N.B. this is more of a learning exercise for me and I cannot guarantee that this project will always be up-to-date or even stable.
